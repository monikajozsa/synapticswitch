0) you will need a github account

1) open terminal, go to location where you want to add this github repository/folder; add a github repository
git clone https://github.com/monikajozsa/synapticswitch
you will need your username and password that you chose in step 0)

2) now you have a folder that you can manage out of the terminal, you can add and delete folders and files BUT it will not be visible to me unless you do the following

3) to save whatever you did, you need to do three things (terminal at the github location)
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "short description of change"
3*. git push origin main
when you first do 3. it needs an extra -u so it is "git push -u origin main"

4) IMPORTANT - before you edit the folder next time, to see what I did in the meantime, you need to "refresh" your github folder (EVERY TIME)
you do this by typing (terminal at the github location)
git pull origin main
requires username and password


Terminal:
you can navigate between folders by typing "cd your_location", can get to parent folder by "cd ..", can list the content of the current folder by ls, can make a folder by "mkdit name_of_new_folder" and many other things but this should be enough
